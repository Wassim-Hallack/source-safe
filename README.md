## 🏗 System Architecture  
Built with **scalability, maintainability, and efficiency** in mind:  
- **Service-Repository Pattern** – Separates business logic from data access.  
- **MVC Architecture** – Organizes components into Controller, View, Model, and Service layers.  
- **Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)** – Used for **logging, monitoring, and notifications** without modifying core logic.
